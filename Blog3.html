                Games are something that has fascinated me every time I played it. The first game that I ever played was "Max Payne",  a game made by Remedy Entertainment on the year 2001. It features a man going throught a Tought time in his life, and how he takes his revenge. Eventually, I moved on to other games like Spider Man, Hitman and later had an interest in fps games like Counter Strike, Apex Legends, Rainbow 6, Valorant and the like.

                At one point, I started to wonder how games are being made, so I decided to search about game engines. Upon learning how they are being made in different styles and mechanics, my interest got to a peak making me explore more games having different genres. For me though, gaming does not only mean to play, but to also understand how the game works (AI, objects, NPCs). 
            </p> 
            <p>In my opinion, if you truly want to enjoy playing games and get immersed, understanding game mechanics is vital, only then will you be able to truly appreciate the developers and their hardwork ðŸ™‚ And yeah, if you feel you need more games to play, do feel free to ask me games which you haven't played yet or better yet, suggest me some! ðŸ˜„
