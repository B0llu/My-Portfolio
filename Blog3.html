            <h1>How I Got Into Gaming...</h1>
            <p>
                Games are something that has fascinated me every time I played it. The first game that I ever played was "Max Payne",  a game made by Remedy Entertainment on the year 2001. It features a man going throught a Tought time in his life, and how he takes his revenge. Eventually, I moved on to other games like Spider Man, Hitman and later had an interest in fps games like Counter Strike, Apex Legends, Rainbow 6, Valorant and the like. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At one point, I started to wonder how games are being made, so I decided to search about game engines. Upon learning how they are being made in different styles and mechanics, my interest got to a peak making me explore more games having different genres. For me though, gaming does not only mean to play, but to also understand how the game works (AI, objects, NPCs). 
            </p> 
            <p>In my opinion, if you truly want to enjoy playing games and get immersed, understanding game mechanics is vital, only then will you be able to truly appreciate the developers and their hardwork 🙂 And yeah, if you feel you need more games to play, do feel free to ask me games which you haven't played yet or better yet, suggest me some! 😄
