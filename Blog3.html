            <h1>A Trip To Dubai....</h1>
            <p>My First  ever international trip was to Dubai. Every child dreams of looking at the Burj Khalifa from front and from the top to bottom. And that dream was coming true for me.A 8 day trip to dubai after my 10th is just icing on the cake. In dubai we saw many things such as Burj Khalifa, Ferrari World, The Dubai Mall, The Miracle Garden. But the most intresting this was The Infamous Burj Khalifa. Just by looking at photos you can imagin its height. When you actually get close to it you get to know what a enginnering marvel it is. Being able to build such a big building is not a joke. There one elevator which takes 10 people to the top of the tower. And funny enought that elevator is the fastest elevator in the world. They play music and play video in elevator to distract you from the speed of the elevator. From the top Dubai looks diffrent. Its not only sand but a home to multi-millionaire's. Only cars you see on roads are sports car's which cost more than 1 Million. Only regret for me was not being able to see the Golden Ferrari. The arebian desert nights are really fun as they have dance shows Food and much more.Sitting in a car driving in desert was the most thrilling experience of my Life. From the trip I learned how hard I actually have to work to get there. And thats the life lesson I got from that trip.</p>
