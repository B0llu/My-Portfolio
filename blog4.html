            <p>If you haven't watched Anime, I would tell you to go watch it right away! Anime is not just any show, its a different vibe entirely. It can make you laugh your wits out, make you cry like a baby, make you hit your monitor in anger as well :p </p>
                <p>The first Anime I ever watched was Death Note, a psychological thriller, mystery Anime that features a notebook of death, wherein anyone's name, when written dies instantly. Sounds childish upon hearing it first, but anything can look good when presented in the best manner. The show features Light Yagami as the main protagonist and the main holder of the notebook, who kills criminals using the death note as a way of justice to the world and a world renowned detective named "L", who solves mysteries and tries to pursue as to who is the killer. Not about to go all out on the description here at once, but this was just my beginning of my Anime journey.</p>
                <p> It has so many different genres, it won't disappoint anyone who can find a genre suited to him or her. For me, it has changed my life and the way I see things. It has even uplifted me, motivated me in times of need.</p>
                <p>Anime is a vast world, its up to you to select a genre, as everything's has its whites and blacks anyway. Feel free to suggest me some of the best Animes you've watched and don't hesitate to ask me for some as well! ðŸ˜„</p>
