            <h1>My First Ever Interview.</h1>
            <p>A Few days ago I knew nothing about programming. All I knew is that its difficult. My friend told me to at least try so I gave it a shot.I watched so many diffrenet videos about HTML CSS and JavaSript. Having learned so little I was ready to give up. Then I came across neogcamp in which Tanay Sir were teching from basics. I was already late to start the process of getting to mark15. It was a difficult journy. I am still not good at Java Script but im willing to effort into it. Today as im writing this blog to complete my final mark im ready to give my first ever Interview for levelOne neogcamp. I know that I will panic in interview and  I will forget logic. But this interview will be a great start to my codding journy. If i get into camp I will be more than happy. Even if I dont get into camp I will know that I have to work even hard but I will never give up. So now I will submit my Portfolio and lets see what happens in my First Ever Interview. I will update this blog as soon as im done with the Interview so stay tuned</p>
